            <div>
              <p>
                Homerton May Ball will be open to all members of the University, but priority will
                be given to students of Homerton College, who will be able to buy tickets in
                advance of other students and alumni of Homerton College. Tickets will go on

          <li>
            <a>I am an alumnus of Homerton College, can I buy tickets to Homerton May Ball?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                Yes, tickets will be available to alumni of the College. All alumni of Homerton
                College will be sent an access key by email to enable them to reserve tickets
                through our ticketing system. Tickets will be released for alumni
                at 8pm on 4<sup>th</sup> February.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a>Can I buy tickets for my friends?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                Each ticket applicant can buy up to three guest tickets in addition to their own.
                These tickets may be for current students at any college, alumni, or family/friends
                from outside the University. As the primary applicant, you will be responsible for
                the payment and collection of these tickets. Please note that all guests must be at
                least 18 years of age by 16<sup>th</sup> June 2017, and will be required to
                provide photographic ID to prove this on entry.

          <li>
            <a>Can I change my ticket type after reserving or buying my ticket?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                It is not possible to change your ticket type after confirmation has been sent
                that your ticket is reserved. If you wish to change your ticket type you must
                cancel your application and reapply for a new ticket. Please note that due to
                the popularity of May Balls this might mean you are unable to buy
                a ticket for the event.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a>Can I pay by cash, cheque or card?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, it is not possible to pay for your tickets by card.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it is possible to pay by cash or cheque. All cheques must be made payable
                to “Colophon Limited”, and any cash or cheque payments must be placed in a sealed
                envelope and handed in to the HUS Office Manager, Emma Themba, during HUS office
                hours (10am–2pm). Please include on this envelope the following information:
              </p>
              <ul class="display">
                <li>Your name as primary applicant</li>
                <li>Your payment reference</li>
                <li>Total paid</li>
                <li>The names of any guests on your application</li>
                <li>The number &amp; type(s) of tickets being paid for</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Please note that it is likely to take longer to process cash or cheque payments
                and bank transfer is preferred where possible.
              </p>
            </div>

          <li>
            <a>Can I get a refund for my ticket?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                No refunds will be given for tickets to Homerton May Ball. Ticket applications
                may be cancelled before payment has been made; however, once you have paid for your
                ticket(s) it is your responsibility to arrange for an alternative buyer and any name
                changes if you or your guest(s) can no longer attend.

          <li>
            <a>How do I change the name on a ticket?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                From the 18<sup>th</sup> of February it will be possible to make name changes on
                tickets that have already been paid for. This will be handled via the online ticketing
                system. An administrative fee will be levied for name changes at the following rates:
              </p>
              <ul class="display">
                <li>£10 (before 16<sup>th</sup> March 2017)</li>
                <li>£20 (before 31<sup>st</sup> April 2017)</li>
                <li>£30 (before 31<sup>st</sup> May 2017)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                It is not possible to make name changes on tickets that have not yet been paid for.
                Any name changes made after the 31<sup>st</sup> of May may cost an additional amount;
                they are made at the discretion of the Committee and you will be required to contact
                the <a href="mailto:mayball-ticketing@homerton.cam.ac.uk">Ticketing Officer</a>
                directly to arrange this.

          <li>
            <a>What if I have specific dietary requirements?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                Primary ticket holders will have the opportunity to fill out a form on behalf of
                themselves and any accompanying guest(s) detailing their specific dietary
                requirements (if any). Catering arrangements will be made for all dietary
                requirements and allergies, and catering staff on the night will be able to
                advise on this. For those guests who do not wish to drink alcohol, a variety of
                soft drinks and water will be provided at every bar.

          <li>
            <a>What if I have specific access requirements?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                Homerton College is entirely wheelchair accessible. However, the event will include
                grassed areas, the accessibility of which cannot be guaranteed in the event of
                adverse weather. We advise any guests with specific access requirements to get in
                contact with the Committee in advance in order to
                ensure that adequate provisions are made.
              </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <a>What is the dress code for the event?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                Like most May Balls, Homerton May Ball will be a black tie event. This means either
                a tuxedo/dinner jacket with bow tie, an evening or ball gown, or
                military/national dress. The Committee reserves the right to refuse entry to any
                guests not adhering to the dress code.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a>From what time can I queue?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                Queuing for the event will be open from 7pm for Standard ticket holders. Guests with
                Queue Jump tickets will be invited to queue separately and are advised to arrive
                from 8pm. Guests with Dining tickets will be registered when arriving at the drinks
                reception and are not expected to queue. More information on the location of the
                queue will be given at the time of ticket collection. Please note that if you are
                a guest on an application, you are advised to queue with the primary ticket holder,
                and will be expected to bring your own photographic ID.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <a>Can I arrive at any time?</a>
            <div>
                <p>
                Entry to the event will begin at 9pm and close at 11pm. Any guests arriving after
                11pm will be refused entry to the event, even if they have a valid ticket. Please
                note that you will not be allowed to leave and re-enter the event at any point.

          <li>
            <a>Will there be a cloakroom?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                A cloakroom will be provided free of charge on the night and labelled in guest
                programmes. Guests will be given a cloakroom ticket that they must retain in order
                to collect their belongings later. Any items left in the cloakroom after 5am on
                17<sup>th</sup> June will be stored by the Homerton Union of Students as lost
                property for the remainder of term. All items are left at guests’ own risk—the
                Committee does not accept any liability for damage or loss incurred.
              </p>
            </div>

          <li>
            <a>How can I collect my ticket(s)?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                Information on where and when to collect your ticket(s) will be provided in May. All
                ticket collections will take place at Homerton College.
              </p>
              <p>
                The primary ticket holder is responsible for collecting and distributing all the
                tickets in their application, and must sign to confirm they have collected the
                tickets. If you are unable to collect your ticket(s) during the allotted times,
                you may nominate a friend to pick up your ticket(s) and sign on your behalf by
                getting in contact with the Ticketing Officer
                <a href="mailto:mayball-ticketing@homerton.cam.ac.uk">by email</a>.

          <li>
            <a>Do I just need my ticket to gain entry to the ball?</a>
            <div>
              <p>
                In addition to your ticket, you will need to present valid photographic ID to gain
                entry to the event. The name on your ticket must match the name on your ID, and you
                must be able to prove that you are at least 18 years of age. Current students of the
                University may use their CUSU card as ID, provided the photo is visible.
